# PROGRESS.md — Evidence Research OS

## 2026-09-05 — ASDLC onboarding (complete, awaiting confirmation)

- Audited repo: docs-only (`DOCS/` trio), no code, no git. Read/Grep fallback
  used (no `.codegraph/` index — suggest `codegraph init` once code lands).
- `git init`; micro-commit discipline starts now; no legacy history to preserve.
- Toolchain: Python 3.12.10, Node v22.23.2, git 2.45.1. `uv` NOT installed
  (Phase 0 PBI standardizes it); `pytest` 9.1.1 installed via pip.
- Verification baseline LIVE: `python -m pytest tests/ -q` → 3 passed.
- Wrote `AGENTS.md` (constitution + Context Map + Plane binding),
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` (as-built snapshot), `plans/README.md` (bootstrap index).
- Plane binding: `kcb` / `EVRSH` — verified via MCP. Todo seed: 0 issues.
- Next: user confirms this report → route Phase 0 to asdlc-plan.
